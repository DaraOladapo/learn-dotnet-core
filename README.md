# Learn .NET Core

This is a beginner code sample for learning C# and .NET Core.

## Requirements

- .NET Core Core SDK (Download [here](dot.net))
- Visual Studio Code (Download [here](code.visualstudio.com))

To get the .NET SDK, visit dot.net and get the latest version. After installation, verify you installation by running

    dotnet --version

On my Mac, I have .NET Core 3 SDK Installed as of when writing this. so I get.

    v-daolad@ng-v-daolad MINGW64 /c/Projects/learn-dotnet-core (master)
    $ dotnet --version
    3.1.300

The version number displayed may be different from what you have on your computer which is fine.

Run `dotnet new` and it will show you a list of available app options to build with your installed version of .NET Core
